Please use the dependency requirements specified in https://github.com/automl/nas-bench-x11.
Before running the scripts, please create a folder named '''Results''' so that experimental results can be automatically saved in it.

The file '''RE_crossover_edit_path_center_GEDfitness_random_NoIsomorphism_generation_multiprocessing_statistics_trueMP_GRU_theory.py'''
is for generating the results regarding GED-to-GRU.
The file '''RE_crossover_edit_path_center_GEDfitness_random_NoIsomorphism_generation_multiprocessing_statistics_trueMP_LSTM_theory.py'''
is for generating the results regarding GED-to-LSTM.
The file '''ged-to-optimal_heatmap_empirical_icml.py" is for generating the results used for Section "Applicability of the Theory'''.
